J-graphs are graphical representations of NMR scalar coupling constants. They can be used to [facilitate the assignment of homonuclear coupling constants](assembleCouplingNetwork), *i.e.* make pairs of protons with equal values of J.

An on-line dynamic [J-graph visualizer](./html/chart_example_from_d3-graph-gallery_zoom.html) shows how J-Graph can be used to assign coupling constants.

For two-dimensional COSY cross-peaks, a two-dimensional representation of coupling constants was introduced. This work is inspired by it. (D. Jeannerat, PhD thesis, Group G. Bodenhausen).
