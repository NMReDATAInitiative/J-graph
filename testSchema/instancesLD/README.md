About linked data:


Common Linked Data Fields

    Timestamp
        Represents when the data was created, modified, or recorded.
        Common alternative names:
            dateCreated
            dateModified
            datePublished
            createdAt
            updatedAt
            timeStamp

    Source
        Indicates where the data originated from (e.g., an external database, an API, a document).
        Common alternative names:
            provenance
            dataSource
            origin
            generatedBy
            reference
            sourceURI

Other Typical Linked Data Fields

These fields are often used in structured datasets to describe provenance, authorship, and relationships:

    Identifier
        Unique ID for the entity (e.g., UUID, DOI).
        Alternatives: id, identifier, uuid
    Creator/Author
        Who created or contributed to the data.
        Alternatives: creator, author, contributor
    License
        Information about rights and usage.
        Alternatives: rights, license, termsOfUse
    Context
        The broader framework in which the data exists.
        Alternatives: schemaContext, @context (in JSON-LD)
